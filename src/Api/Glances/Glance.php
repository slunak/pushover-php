/**
 * Pushover Glances API (Beta).
 * With Pushover's Glances API, you can push small bits of data directly to a constantly-updated screen,
 * referred to as a widget, such as a complication on your smart watch or a widget on your phone's lock screen.
 * Glances API is used for sending short pieces of text or numerical data, such as "Garage door open" in response to an alarm system,
 * or just "30" representing the number of items sold in your store today.
 * These pieces of data should be low-priority since they often cannot get updated in real-time or very frequently,
 * and they must be concise because they are often viewed on small screens such as a watch face.
